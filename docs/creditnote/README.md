# credit_note

## Overview

The Credit Note resource represents a credit note that has been generated for a customer. Credit Notes are generated when a customer's billing interval has elapsed, and are updated when a customer's invoice is paid.

### Available Operations

* [list](#list) - List credit notes

## list

This endpoint returns a list of all [`Credit Note`](../reference/Orb-API.json/components/schemas/Credit-note)s for an account in a list format. 

The list of credit notes is ordered starting from the most recently created date. The response also includes [`pagination_metadata`](../api/pagination), which lets the caller retrieve the next page of results if they exist.

### Example Usage

```python
import orb
from orb.models import operations

s = orb.Orb(
    security=shared.Security(
        api_key_auth="YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN_HERE",
    ),
)


res = s.credit_note.list('iure', 'saepe', 'quidem')

if res.list_credit_note_200_application_json_object is not None:
    # handle response
```
